I am most proud of the cloud code  and how it can move.  I found it very confusing at first on how it should work but I was very happy once it started to work. I am also very happy I got the island to move as it fits the music theme very well

I am most proud of the character designs and their reactions to the music. Programming is a weakness of mine and figuring out how to make the characterâ€™s mouth and instruments react to the music was a breakthrough for me. It also took a while to figure out the placement of each character, as well as building them exclusively through code. While the code might not be extremely impressive in its complexity, it took a long time to put together and get accurate.

I'm most proud of how I managed to mix the audio tracks to match one another, i'm also very proud of how I managed to make the multi-track work on processing, there is very little information on the web about multiple audio files so I needed to make everything from scratch. I'm proud of the cholor scheme that I used for the music line since it's the same that the band used for the cover of the album from which the song comes from
